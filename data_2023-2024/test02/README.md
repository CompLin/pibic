# Folder contents
This folder contains the relevant data of the second parsing experiment of the PIBIC project of 2023 and 2024. The files `test-1.conllu`, `train-1.conll`, `test-2.conllu`, `train-2.conll` etc. result from sucessive splits of `../test01/yrl_complin-ud-test.conllu`, which encompasses the whole UD_Nheengatu-CompLin treebank, as described in `../test01`, including sentences with the _Casasnovas2006_ `sent_id` prefix. The split was performed 10 times by the `TestSuite.py` script, each time alocating 10% and 90% of the treebank sentences to the test and train sets, respectively.
